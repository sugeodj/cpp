Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The team with fewer percents drops substantially when increasing the amount.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

it looked as if the predictions stabilised around the 10000 mark
