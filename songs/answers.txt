It seems that the users top 100 songs seem to reflect the top radio music at the current time.
A few soundcloud rappers mixed in there such as trippie redd, murda beatz, as well as some rappers such as 21 savage, cardi b, and drake.

I presume that the avgEnergy calculated in the sql query will be the most acdcurate means of data to represent the style of music they listen to,
and that majority of the soungs in there top 100 likely fall close to this value.

I would propose utilising jupyterlabs/notes along with python and the dataset file to analyse and visualise trends within and between the data,
it may then be possible to expand our dataset to include a wider variety that covers a larger scale to draw an analysis of the current state
of the music charts.
